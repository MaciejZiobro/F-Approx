# F-Aprrox
An application to aprroximate functions with polynomial using Tylor's series

# Usage
Simply enter function of x, then the approximation accuracy you want to get. The bigger degree of polynomial the higher accuracy you'll get, when the degree is infinity the Tyler's polynomial is equal to function. Then enter the point on x-axis around which the function will be approximated.

# Desmos 
It's recomended to check radius of convergence on your own in [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)

# ToDo
- Repairing exponential and logarithmic functions
- Calculating radius of convergence in app with a certain accuracy
